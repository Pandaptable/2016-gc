old classiccounter game coordinator that was never deployed, it's like 95% vibecoded and has a LOT of issues (steamids being stored as strings for example... or if you send enough requests their gc will just fucking die)

It was bought by the owner of [fragmount](https://fragmount.net/) sometime in mid 2025. (to my knowledge this is also the GC they currently use)
