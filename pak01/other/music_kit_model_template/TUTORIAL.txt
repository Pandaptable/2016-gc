For the model:

1. Basically what u wanna do is rename/change every reference of "weiland_01" from the template i provided to your music kit artist name of choice, numerically assigned from _01 to _02 if ur adding more etc (u have to edit the .qc file) 
2. Open up Crowbar.exe, add your CC SDK version of the game to the games list, then just compile music_kit_artistname_01.qc
3. Put your compiled files into \pak01\models\inventory_items\music_kits

For the textures:

1. You're going to have to make 2 textures for the music kits, mp3_detail.vmt (for the text) and mp3_screen.vmt (for the album cover)
2. To make mp3_screen.vmt is pretty easy, just export the album cover as a 512x512 image, then put that image into https://tf.heybey.org/vtfconv/
3. To make the text (mp3_detail.vmt) you will have to install the font "amiga4ever pro2.ttf", its not the same exact font but its close enough
4. Then, if you have photoshop, open up "create textures\mp3_detail.psd" and change the "Weiland" (artist name) and "Colors" (song name) (if it looks like the dots moved over just delete/add new dots to match the original)

For the sounds:

this is a little complicated to cover here, just ask me ig, but basically u will have to time the audio in audacity and add sync points (like for example where a clap/repeat/snare/bass whatever happens) that look something like this:

"syncpoints_1"
{
    "0" "4.282000"
    "1" "7.711000"
    "2" "11.140000"
    "3" "14.569000"
    "4" "17.997000"
    "5" "20.997000"
}

to the "\pak01\sound\music\artist_01\game_sounds_music.txt" file and very important is to change the artist name from within the file to whatever you need it to be

For the icon:

1. Go to the "icon" folder, i've provided a template for you to overlay your cover of choice, you will have to warp/skew the image

!!! and if you are going to actually add a music kit, dont forget to add it to game_sounds_manifest.txt file and push it to clients
and obviously items_game and csgo_english aswell
