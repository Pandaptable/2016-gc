!! ONLY COMPILE THE .vpk FILES IF YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE READY just to make sure the md5 hashes dont fuck up !!
also for compilation u need the last version of the .vpk's in the folder aswell

old note: im not sure we can actually host this on github pages if we wanna add stuff to this, it will add files to the .vpks no matter what chunk size u set after u compile them, and it doesnt really like adding additional vpk files when u overwrite/recompile on the existing vpk files

new note: i ended up not making them below 100mbs, when u overwrite/change/add files to the vpks it attempts to be around 110-150mbs per vpk anyways for some stupid reason, and i cant change it
but i did notice that alot of valves vpks look exactly the same as mine when i put chunk size to 100, and when u add or remove stuff from the vpks it can go up to like 150mbs per pakfile, if u look at csgo's official pak files theres the same pattern there too
so i believe im using the same exact method as valve uses to build and update them, again i cant set a limit on how big each pakfile is unfortunately
